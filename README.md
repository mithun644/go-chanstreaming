## Introduction

In modern software development, handling data streams efficiently is essential. Go ChanStreaming provides a simple and effective way to build concurrent data processing and streaming pipelines using channels. With this library, you can harness the power of Goâ€™s concurrency model while keeping your code clean and readable.

## Features

- **Concurrency**: Utilize Goâ€™s goroutines and channels for parallel data processing.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to be minimalistic without sacrificing performance.
- **Flexible**: Supports various data types and processing patterns.
- **Easy to use**: Simple API for quick integration into your projects.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with Go ChanStreaming, you need to install the library. You can do this by running:

```bash
go get github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming
```

### Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example to show how to use Go ChanStreaming in your project. 

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/mithun644/go-chanstreaming"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize your stream
    stream := chanstreaming.NewStream()

    // Add data to the stream
    stream.AddData("Hello, World!")
    stream.AddData("Go is awesome!")

    // Process the data
    stream.Process(func(data string) {
        fmt.Println(data)
    })
}
```
